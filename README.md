# Homework-6-Weather-Dashboard

# Desc:
The user may search for a city in the search bar. On pressing 'enter,' the city is listed below the search bar in the app's search history. The city's present weather conditions will also show up in the large box on the right, and below it is a five-day forecast for that city. 

Searching for a new city will likewise add that city to the search history and display that city's weather information. Clicking on a city name in the search history will recall that city's weather information.
