# Weather-Dashboard

# Desc:
The user may search for a city in the search bar. On pressing 'enter,' the city is listed below the search bar in the app's search history. The city's present weather conditions will also show up in the large box on the right, and below it is a five-day forecast for that city. 

Searching for a new city will likewise add that city to the search history and display that city's weather information. Clicking on a city name in the search history will recall that city's weather information.

# Progress:
Work Day 1:
    Created basic formatting of HTML and CSS styles.

Work Day 2:
    jQuery for searching for a city (in the USA), displaying its current weather (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index) as well as a matching weather icon established. 

    To-do:
        Store searched cities locally
        Display searched city's 5-day forecast (starting day after initial search)

Work Day 3:
    jQuery for creating a 5-day forecast established. 

    Still need to sort out localStorage of searched cities.

Work Day 4:
    P 1:
        Now storing cities locally.

        Unforseen error when printing local storage - entirety of local storage printed after every search. 

        Still need to attach functionality to allow clicking on searched cities to pull up city's weather data.
    
    P 2:
        Storing cities properly. Clicking searched city re-searches that information. Last search remains on refresh.

WORK DAY 5:
    When I saw that I'd forgotten about the time difference, I rushed a final commit and submitted my homework. Earlier today I discovered that I'd left several things undone and forgotten to remove excess code. I've fixed it now - it may be late, but at least now it's complete.
